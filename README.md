# Project Radium
**Project Radium** comprises of two mods that aim to improve the soundscape of ArmA 3 by adding new sounds and music to the *real-time Zeus editor.*

The GitHub repository serves as a easy way to commit changes and add new songs without much hassle.

### Radium's Custom Soundtracks

A high-quality, soundtrack mod that adds over **200** songs to your Zeus experience.

### Radium's Awesome Soundpack

Unique, high-quality sounds packaged and tailored for use in the Zeus editor.

### Want to Contribute?
- ArmA 3 only accepts `.ogg` files. Please don't send me `.mp3` or other file formats.
- Make sure you name the filename appropriately. Although most of the mod is not natively in it, I would prefer if you use `camelCase` for file names. *e.g. RCS_songName.ogg*
- Only change parts of the code you need to. If you're adding a song or sound, only add in those bits of code. Please do not change my code or anyone elses without permission.
